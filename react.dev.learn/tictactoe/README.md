# Tic-Tac-Toe

As presented in the Quick Start tutorial at [React.dev](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). I went through the tutorial and all but one of the extra exercises. I went a little off script in places because I wanted to experiment to see if my hunches would work out.

**NOTE** --
I am very new to React. At this point in my history, I have no other React knowledge other than what I picked up in the tutorial. As such there are probably(definitely?) better ways to accomplish what I wrote.
